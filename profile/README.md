## Welcome to Etherlink's GitHub 👋

Etherlink is a decentralized & EVM compatible Layer-2 blockchain built on Tezos. Why should you care? Because decentralization matters. Decentralization provides censorship resistance, and a peace of mind that your assets will be stored on a reliable, secure and fast chain. Decentralisation, speed and UX are Tezos' strengths, and now your favourite EVM apps can enjoy it too. Oh and by the way, Etherlink will upgrade alongside Tezos L1, so stay tuned 👀
